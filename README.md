# Submitted Papers: Mercatus Center's _Policy Analytics Colloquium_

## Danilo Freire

Here are two working papers I have submitted to Mercatus Center's _Policy
Analytics Colloquium_ in March 2020. The first paper is "Democratising Policy
Analytics with AutoML" and it discusses how social scientists can use automated
machine learning algorithms in their research. The second paper is titled "How
to Improve Data Validation in Five Steps", which offers a few suggestions on
how to increase the validity of a novel dataset.
